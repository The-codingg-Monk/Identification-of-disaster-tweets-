Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

Problem Statement-

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. Take this example:
a user tweets--
" On plus side LOOK AT THE SKY LAST NIGHT T WAS ABLAZE"

The author explicitly uses the word “ABLAZE” but means it metaphorically. This is clear to a human right away, especially with the visual aid. But it’s less clear to a machine.I had to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. I analysed 10000 tweets fot this task.
The dataset was created by the company figure-eight and originally shared on their ‘Data For Everyone’ website here.

In this model for word embedding i used Tfidf and word2vec. 
for modelling I used Logistic Regresion, knn, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, xgboost,SVM, and navie bayes.

Result-- Found naive bayes as the best generalized model with Tfidf word embedding.
